# <p align="center"> USING SQL TO CLEAN, MODEL AND ANALYSE DATA TO DETERMINE THE TOP FIVE CATEGORY CONTENT FOR A CLIENT

## INTRODUCTION

In this project, a popular social media company who were considering doing an IPO wanted an analysis of their top five content categories.  They provided a number of datasets for us to study and drive meaningful insights from. I had to understand the client's requirements and identified the datasets that will be required to answer the client's business question.

I started with cleaning the data and merged them to prepare the data for analysis.

Finally, I used the clean data to answer the client's business question by deriving the top five content categories. I used SQL as the primary tool for cleaning, modelling and analysing the data.
